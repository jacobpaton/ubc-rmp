Browser extension for UBC course registration to let students access Rate My Prof info easier.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable Developer Mode via a toggle
4. Unpack the extension by selecting the cloned dir

## Why?

A typical workflow of a UBC student when registering a course is:
1. Open one of the sections in a new tab
2. Copy the professor name
3. Paste it into Rate My Prof (RMP) search box
4. Review ratings
4. Decide to add the course or not to the schedule
5. Repeat

Searching for RMP info gets time consuming real fast.

This extension exposes RMP Professor data on course index page via cursor hover on lecture link.
