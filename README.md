## Why?

A typical workflow of a UBC student when registering a course is:
1. Open one of the sections in a new tab
2. Copy the professor name
3. Paste it into Rate My Prof (RMP) search box
4. Review ratings
5. Decide to add the course or not to the schedule
6. Repeat

Searching for RMP info gets time consuming real fast.

This extension hopes to make this process less stressful than it already is
